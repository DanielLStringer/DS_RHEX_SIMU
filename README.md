# DS_RHEX_SIMU

Follow the instructions on https://github.com/AranBSmith/rhex-ite,
but instead of rhex_simu, install this code (DS_rhex_simu), 
and ignore the stuff called limbo and anything beneath this.

Compile this code with:

./waf configure --prefix=$RESIBOTS_DIR
./waf

Run this code with:
./build/DS_test 0 1 raised.skel

(change the first number, ie.0, to change the test environment, up to 12)

This archive, and this readme, is likely to be slightly altered in the coming week to make it easier/more clear
